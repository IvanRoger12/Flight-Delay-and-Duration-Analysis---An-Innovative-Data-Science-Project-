scripts/: Python scripts for data processing and visualization.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
Installation
To run the project, you need to have Python 3 installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

bash
Copier le code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

Airline: The airline operating the flight.
Source: The departure city.
Destination: The arrival city.
Total_Stops: The number of stops the flight makes.
Price: The ticket price in ₹.
Date: The day of the month the flight departs.
Month: The month the flight departs.
Year: The year the flight departs.
Dep_hours: The departure hour.
Dep_min: The departure minute.
Arrival_hours: The arrival hour.
Arrival_min: The arrival minute.
Total_Duration_Minutes: The total flight duration in minutes (computed from the departure and arrival times).
Analysis and Modeling
Data Exploration
Airline with the Highest Average Prices: Analysis to find which airline has the highest average ticket prices.
Impact of Number of Stops on Ticket Prices: Analysis to understand how the number of stops impacts ticket prices.
Source City with the Highest Average Flight Duration: Analysis to determine which source city has the highest average flight duration.
Modeling
Linear Regression Model: Built to predict flight durations. The model achieved an MAE of 232.86 minutes and an R² of 0.56.
Advanced Analyses
Correlation Analysis: Identified the correlations between different features and the flight duration.
Feature Importance Using Random Forest: Determined the importance of different features in predicting flight duration.
Clustering Analysis: Grouped similar flights together to identify patterns using K-means clustering.
Time Series Analysis: Analyzed trends over time, such as how flight prices have changed over the months.
Visualizations
The project includes several visualizations to illustrate the findings:

Average Price per Airline
Impact of Number of Stops on Ticket Prices
Distribution of Flight Durations
Predictions vs Actual Values
Correlation Matrix
Feature Importance
Clustering of Flights
Average Flight Price Over Months
Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of flight data, identifying key factors influencing flight durations and building predictive models. The advanced analyses offer deeper insights into the data, making the findings more robust and actionable.

Future Work
Future improvements could include:

Incorporating additional data such as weather conditions and historical delay information.
Using more advanced machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy.
Extending the analysis to other aspects of flight performance and customer satisfaction.
